It empowers the community to enhance productivity by staying focused and managing tasks effectively. Anyone can join as a distributor to help spread and grow the project!

## About Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet powerful time management method that helps boost focus and minimize distractions. The technique involves:

- Working for a **25-minute session** called a "pomodoro"
- Taking a **5-minute break** after each pomodoro
- After completing **four pomodoros**, taking a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes)

This method is loved for its ability to improve concentration and efficiency, making it perfect for studying, working, and managing various tasks.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Start a 25-minute session with a built-in timer.
- **Custom Breaks**: Easily manage short (5 minutes) and long (15-30 minutes) breaks.
- **Task Management**: Add and organize tasks to stay on track.
- **Notifications**: Get alerts when a pomodoro or break session ends.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of completed pomodoros to visualize productivity.
